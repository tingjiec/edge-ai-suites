"""Synthetic classroom-transcript builder for the long-context benchmark.

Builds a chat prompt whose token count exactly matches a target size, or fails
explicitly when the tokenizer cannot converge, so trial_runner.py can push the real OpenVINO
pipeline up to a given context length and measure whether *this hardware* can
prefill and decode it without running out of memory.

Everything here is model-agnostic: it only needs a HuggingFace-style tokenizer
(``encode`` / ``decode`` / ``apply_chat_template``), so it can be unit-tested
with a stub tokenizer and no model download. This mirrors the approach in
refer/long_context/long_context_probe.py -- the content is irrelevant to the
validation, only the token *volume* matters, but realistic, varied dialog keeps
the tokenizer's merge behaviour representative of a real transcript instead of a
single repeated token.
