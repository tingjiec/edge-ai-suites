# Creates/reuses the SAME backend venv setup-smart-classroom.ps1 creates
# ("smartclassroom", sibling of smart-classroom/) so this tool and the main app
# share one install of the OpenVINO/torch stack instead of duplicating several
# GB of packages. Running the full setup script later (or having already run
# it) is detected as "already exists" -- this script never conflicts with it.

# relative to this script's own location):
#   .\components\llm\context_bench\setup_env.ps1

# If PowerShell blocks the script with an UnauthorizedAccess/SecurityError:
