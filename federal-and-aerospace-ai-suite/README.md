AI-enabled applications and supporting components for aerospace and defense edge deployments.

## Applications

### Handheld Multi-Modal

The Handheld Multi-Modal application is a full-stack AI inference and observability
platform for handheld scenarios. It is deployed on top of the
Edge Node Infrastructure software - an edge computing platform, which enables hardware
acceleration capabilities. See [Infrastructure Setup](handheld-multi-modal/docs/user-guide/infrastructure-setup.md) for build and provisioning steps.

The application combines LLM inference capability served through the OpenVINO
Model Server platform, speech-to-text transcription through the Whisper service,
a chat UI through the Open WebUI software, and metrics information through
the Grafana dashboard; and runs with the
[Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool) for pipeline visualization.

See [`handheld-multi-modal/`](handheld-multi-modal/README.md).

### Deterministic Threat Detection (Preview)

[Deterministic Threat Detection](deterministic-threat-detection) : A sample application that showcases Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) to enable deterministic, low-latency transmission of AI-processed video and sensor data alongside best-effort traffic on a shared network. This application is currently in preview. [User Docs](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/blob/main/federal-and-aerospace-ai-suite/deterministic-threat-detection/docs/user-guide/index.md)



### UAV Vision Analytics

[UAV Vision Analytics](uav-vision-analytics) : An AI-powered UAV object detection application with live telemetry overlay, built on Intel DL Streamer Pipeline Server. It processes video from a UAV-mounted camera (or simulated video file), runs YOLO11s inference across 80 object classes, and overlays correlated MAVLink telemetry (GPS, altitude, speed, heading) on the output RTSP stream. Supports standalone (pymavlink + PX4 SITL) and UAV Mission Compute SDK deployment modes.
