"""Runs ONE (model, context length) capacity trial for the long-context validator.

The question a trial answers is deliberately narrow, mirroring
refer/long_context/validate_long_context.py: *can this hardware load the model,
prefill a prompt of the requested token size, and decode a few tokens without
running out of memory (or hanging)?* It does NOT judge answer quality -- content
is irrelevant, only whether the box survives the token volume.

Executed as a fresh subprocess per trial (see validate_long_context.py) so that
GPU/host memory from a crashed or OOM'd attempt can never bleed into the next
trial -- the same "convert in a subprocess so memory is fully reclaimed on exit"
rationale already used for model conversion in
components/vlm/vlm_openvino_serving/utils/utils.py::_convert_model_worker.

Memory is sampled by the *orchestrator* (parent), not here: system RAM / GPU
counters are process-wide, so the parent sees this child's footprint just as
well, and -- crucially -- its readings survive even when this child is killed on
a timeout. This child only signals two milestones over the queue so the parent
can time its snapshots: an "loaded" event once the weights are resident (so the
parent can separate weight memory from KV-cache memory), then a "done" event
with the trial outcome.

Because process exit is the resource-reclamation boundary, this module never
tears the pipeline down itself: it reports its result and then calls os._exit()
(see _post_result_and_exit, which documents the native abort that made running
the teardown actively harmful).

OpenVINO / transformers are imported lazily inside run_trial() rather than at
module scope, so this module -- and therefore validate_long_context.py, which
imports it -- can be imported (e.g. for --dry-run) on a machine that doesn't
have the OpenVINO stack installed.

    Destroying an OpenVINO GPU pipeline that has just prefilled a very long
    context can throw an `ov::Exception` from inside a destructor. Observed on
    the 64 GB shared-memory iGPU box at 160K tokens, immediately after a clean
    128K pass:

        openvino_genai.dll!ov::genai::VLMPipeline::~VLMPipeline

    An escaping exception in a destructor is `std::terminate`, not a Python
    exception, so the old `finally: try: del pipe ... except Exception: pass`
    could not contain it -- the process was gone before the next bytecode ran.
    And because that teardown ran *before* the `done` message was posted, the
    abort also destroyed a result the trial had already finished computing: the
    orchestrator saw only `crashed`, with no way to tell whether 160K had in
    fact prefilled and decoded successfully.

    Both halves are fixed by this function. The result is posted first, so an
    abort can no longer erase a completed measurement, and the teardown that
    throws is not run at all. Skipping it does not leak anything: it is the
    design this module already documents. The child exists to run exactly
    one trial, and the orchestrator relies on process exit -- not on Python-level
    cleanup -- to reclaim GPU/host memory between trials. `os._exit()` hands that
    reclamation to the OS, which cannot throw. (The orchestrator waits for the
    reclamation to land before starting the next trial; see
    `validate_long_context._wait_for_memory_settle`.)
